# This file infers the backward probabilities for all the nodes of the treeHMM

# The backward probability for state X and observation at node k is defined as the probability of observing the
# sequence of observations e_k+1, ... ,e_n under the condition that the state at node k is X.

# That is backward_probabilities[X,k] := Prob(E_k+1 = e_k+1, ... , E_n = e_n | X_k = X)
# E_1...E_n = e_1...e_n is the sequence of observed emissions and X_k is a random variable that represents
# the state at node k

            which the tree should be traversed in backward direction(from leaves
            to roots).It's the output of backward_sequence_generator function.
        observed_states_training_nodes: It is a (L * 2) dataframe where L is the number of training
            nodes where state values are known. First column should be the node
            number and the second column being the corresponding known state
            values of the nodes

        probabilities at each node of the tree, where "N" is possible no. of
